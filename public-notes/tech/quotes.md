"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than to have 10 functions operate on 10 data structures." - Alan J. Perlis

"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures and their relationships." -- Linus Torvalds


git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the reasons git has been fairly successful [â€¦] I will, in fact, claim that the difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his code or his data structures more important.
